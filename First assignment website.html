                    Although, quartine was a bit boring is being fun and having nothing to do in the house, my experience was almost completely the opposite.<br><br>
                    Typically, being in quartine means a lot of things and time to ourselves.<br><br>
                    Also to be honest, there is nothing boring about having a lot of time in ur hands we just need to use it wisely don't spend that time useless things. Spend it on how we can entertain others, productive, or purposeful<br><br>
                    There were a few things I did to make my quartine fun. \
                    <div>
                        <ul> 
                            <br>
                            <li>Spending a lot of time with my family which is always well worth the form </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <li>Python</li>
                                <li>HTML</li>        
                                <li>CSS</li>
                                <li>Bootstrap</li>
                                <li>And more, including other web frameworks and sub categories...</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            </li>Playing sports such as;</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Tennis</li>
                                <li>Badminton</li>
                                <li>Basketball</li>
                                <li>Cricket</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                           </li>Exericising</li>
                           <br>
                           <li>Watching art tutorials doing yoga learning new concepts</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    This is basically what my quartine has been like so far.<br><br>
                    Although I did have several moments where I felt down and not spending time doing the normal things I have listed above.
